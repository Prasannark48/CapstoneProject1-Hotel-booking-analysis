# CapstoneProject1-Hotel-booking-analysis

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

A hotel room is a second home. Have you ever remembered the last wonderful hotel experience you had? Or the family meal which was made even more special by the restaurant in which it was enjoyed?

Hospitality is not to change people, but to offer them space where change can take place. Service is a pillar of hospitality, no matter the type of business. From the moment people enter the door, you have the opportunity to make them feel wonderful, and thereâ€™s no better feeling for you, either.

Analytics in the hotelier world today is important, and nowadays this business cannot be run with some sensible and smart use of data.

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

Main aim of the project is to understand and visualize dataset from hotel and customer point of view.
